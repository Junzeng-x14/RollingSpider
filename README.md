# Rolling Spider

This coursework project is one of key part of ME231B (Experimential Advanced Control Design - Spring 2018). The main framework of this project is based on Rolling Spider software package developed by Parrot <https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/RollingSpiderEdu>, where we can adjust controller, do fancy realtime experiments without too many consideration of the framework.
